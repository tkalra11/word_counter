# Word Counter Website

This website is created using HTML5 , CSS3 and Javascript.

It is a simple website that counts the characters , words , sentences , and paragraphs in an inputed text. 

The inspiration for this is to use in my own daily life as a word counter is very helpful in completing my assignments and my own version helps me keep my data secure in case of some sensitive information.

The website is hosted using GitHub Pages and can be found at : [<img alt="Website Image" width="30px" height="30px" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/3735/3735393.png" />](https://tkalra11.github.io/word_counter/)
